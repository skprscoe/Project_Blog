            <h1>Block chain based E- voting</h1>
            <p class="date">Posted on August 20, 2023</p>
            <p>Block chain is new and emerging technology now-a-days in IT industry. This technology is a decentralized way of storing data. It gives better alternative in terms of security for traditional centralized data storing systems. This paper gives idea about how E-Voting system can be secured with Blockchain Technology. In this paper we have done systematic review of previous work in the same area. We selected and reviewed a number of research papers in the same field. These papers suggest us that use of Blockchain Technology will be very effective for voting system. And also this online voting system will be much more secured than the existing system. Electronic voting (E- Voting) is nothing but casting and counting of votes in an electronic manner. This method provides more efficient and cost-effective procedure to conduct voting process. As use of technology increases in certain area the security issues also increase. In e-voting security is necessary. By using the Block chain and its distributed database mechanism we can reduce the chances of any ill-intentioned manipulation of database thus providing a robust security to the electronic- voting systems.</p>
            
            <h2>What exactly block chain is</h2>
            <div class="diagram">

            <P>A blockchain is “a distributed database that maintains a continuously growing list of ordered records, called blocks.” These blocks “are linked using cryptography. Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, a timestamp, and transaction data. A blockchain is a decentralized, distributed and public digital ledger that is used to record transactions across many computers so that the record cannot be altered retroactively without the alteration of all subsequent blocks and the consensus of the network.</P>
            
            
            
            <h2>System Architecture</h2>
            <div class="diagram">
                <img src="working.PNG" alt="Diagram Example">
            </div>
            <p>According to above diagram, voter needs to enter his/her credentials in order to vote. All data is then encrypted and stored as a transaction. This transaction is then broadcasted to every node in network, which in turn is then verified. If network approves transaction, it is stored in a block and added to chain. Note that once a block is added into chain, it stays there forever and can’t be updated. Users can now see results and also trace back transaction if they want. </p>
            <p>Since current voting systems don’t suffice to security needs of modern generation, there is a need to build a system that leverages security, convenience, and trust involved in voting process. Hence voting systems make use of Blockchain technology to add an extra layer of security and encourage people to vote from any time, anywhere without any hassle and makes voting process more cost-effective and time-saving.</p>
